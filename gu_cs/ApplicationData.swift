The main goals of the course are to present a variety of schemes for structuring data so that computer programs can efficiently insert, retrieve, modify, and remove information, to understand and express these operations as formal algorithms, and to analyze these algorithms formally. Using asymptotic analysis, the focus is on the analysis of worst-case running times of algorithms, although the course also covers the analysis of the average-case, amortized, and expected running times for selected algorithms. The data structures that the course surveys include unordered maps, hash tables, general trees, binary trees, ordered maps, search trees, self-balancing trees, multi-way trees, priority queues, heaps, sets, and graphs. Finally, the course reviews elementary sorting algorithms, presents heap-sort, and covers the formal analysis of their running times."

               "The course covers digital systems architecture, assuming only the basics of programming and Boolean logic as background. Computing systems continually become more complex. Naively exploiting the abstract interfaces between technical specialties, sticking with the familiar and accepting the rest on faith, we neither grasp systems as wholes nor understand and create the new. Here, we instead demystify how and why programs make real things happen by sampling a wide spectrum of technology in a bottom-up progression from simple electronics to a representative computer system. That system, rather than being real-world, provides a coherent framework for understanding its purpose and mechanisms, uncluttered by historical artifacts and obscure optimizations. We explore a simple NOT switching breadboard circuit, extend its design to basic logic gates, and go on to briefly discuss 2-d CMOS circuit design, fabrication, and market forces. Looking briefly at historical computing machinery from antiquity onwards, we adopt some concepts, including selections from Boolean logic, digitial arithmetic, information encoding, Finite State Machines (FSM), Turing Machines, and universal simulation. Using a few base digital design elements (MUX, DEMUX, and flipflop), we recursively describe higher-level organizational elements, such as, register files, memories, data-functional units, buses, input/output devices and interfaces, and controller FSMâ€™s. Instruction sets, execution phases, data and instruction flow, Harvard and von Neumann architectures, clocks, timing, and interaction protocol ideas are developed in the process of debugging our simplified, 16-bit, single-threaded, pipelined processor which includes split L1 caches, memory-mapped input/output devices, priority interrupts, privileged execution, memory protection, and address translation. We write small programs, both as text versions of pure binaries as well as using a one-pass assembler, and trace their circuit activity during execution. Along the way, we introduce the low-level hardware/software interface and system structure, including program loading, libraries and linking, stacks, saving and restoring execution state, system calls, input/output device polling and interrupts, memory maps, memory address translation, memory protection, privileged execution, and memory/IO bus and cache object names and name decoding and access protocols. We manage our project materials in a unix command-line environment using a version-control system, along with other unix tools, and therefore also briefly discuss processes, shells, forking, shell environment variables, bash and make syntax, and shell scripts and their execution. Workload includes written assignments, a mid-term exam, a comprehensive final exam, and a processor exploration project consisting of a series of FPGA lab exercises."
